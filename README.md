# Coven CLI
All the news a programmer needs in your command line!

### Introduction

latest programming news.

### Why?

Because Coven is *awesome* (give the cool Coven dev [Ryan](https://github.com/goddamnyouryan) your love). Also, what better way to learn vi than to program something with it? This is my first project done entirely in vi. And I love it more and more each day.
